# UNMBuddy
## Project Description
This project aims to provide a consolidated platform (UNMBuddy) to students and staff to support teaching and learning. Given the lack of knowledge about digital technologies and student engagement, one specific objective of the proposal is to develop an understanding of the determinants of new and current students’ engagement or lack of at University of Nottingham (UNM) through digital technologies. UNMBuddy seeks to facilitate asynchronous engagement and awareness among the two groups of students (current and newly commencing).
